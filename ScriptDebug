     #!/bin/bash
    set -o nounset
    set -o errexit
    
    # The two settings also have shorthands (“-u” and “-e”) but the longer versions are more readable.
    
    
   Favor  $() over backticks (`)
      Backticks are hard to read and in some fonts easily confused with single quotes.
      $()also permits nesting without the quoting headaches.

    # both commands below print out: A-B-C-D
    echo "A-`echo B-\`echo C-\\\`echo D\\\`\``"
    echo "A-$(echo B-$(echo C-$(echo D)))"
    
    
    Favor [[]] (double brackets) over [] 
    
1.single bracket

    [ "${name}" \> "a" -o ${name} \< "m" ]

2.double brackets

     [[ "${name}" > "a" && "${name}" < "m"  ]]
    
    
3.Regular Expressions/Globbing

These new capabilities within double brackets are best illustrated via examples:

    t="abc123"
    [[ "$t" == abc* ]]         # true (globbing)
    [[ "$t" == "abc*" ]]       # false (literal matching)
    [[ "$t" =~ [abc]+[123]+ ]] # true (regular expression)
    [[ "$t" =~ "abc*" ]]       # false (literal matching)

Note, that starting with bash version 3.2 the regular or globbing expression
must not be quoted. If your expression contains whitespace you can store it in a variable:

    r="a b+"
    [[ "a bbb" =~ $r ]]        # true
      

Globbing based string matching  is also available via the case statement:

    case $t in
    abc*)  <action> ;;
    esac


4.String Manipulation

Bash has a number of (underappreciated) ways to manipulate strings.

Basics

    f="path1/path2/file.ext"  

    len="${#f}" # = 20 (string length) 

    # slicing: ${<var>:<start>} or ${<var>:<start>:<length>}
    slice1="${f:6}" # = "path2/file.ext"
    slice2="${f:6:5}" # = "path2"
    slice3="${f: -8}" # = "file.ext"(Note: space before "-")
    pos=6
    len=5
    slice4="${f:${pos}:${len}}" # = "path2"


Substitution (with globbing)

    f="path1/path2/file.ext"  

    single_subst="${f/path?/x}"   # = "x/path2/file.ext"
    global_subst="${f//path?/x}"  # = "x/x/file.ext" 

    # string splitting
    readonly DIR_SEP="/"
    array=(${f//${DIR_SEP}/ })
    second_dir="${array[1]}"     # = path2


Deletion at beginning/end (with globbing)

    f="path1/path2/file.ext" 

    # deletion at string beginning extension="${f#*.}"  # = "ext" 

    # greedy deletion at string beginning
    filename="${f##*/}"  # = "file.ext" 

    # deletion at string end
    dirname="${f%/*}"    # = "path1/path2" 

    # greedy deletion at end
    root="${f%%/*}"      # = "path1"


Avoiding Temporary Files
Some commands expect filenames as parameters  so straightforward pipelining does not work.
This is where <() operator comes in handy as it takes a command and transforms it into something
which can be used as a filename:

    # download and diff two webpages
    diff <(wget -O - url1) <(wget -O - url2)

Also useful are "here documents" which allow arbitrary multi-line string to be passed
in on stdin. The two occurrences  of 'MARKER' brackets the document.
'MARKER' can be any text.

    # DELIMITER is an arbitrary string
    command  << MARKER
    ...
    ${var}
    $(cmd)
    ...
    MARKER


If parameter substitution is undesirable simply put quotes around the first occurrence of MARKER:

    command << 'MARKER'
    ...
    no substitution is happening here.
    $ (dollar sign) is passed through verbatim.
    ...
    MARKER


Built-In Variables
For reference
$0   name of the script
$n   positional parameters to script/function
$$   PID of the script
$!    PID of the last command executed (and run in the background)
$?   exit status of the last command  (${PIPESTATUS} for pipelined commands)
$#   number of parameters to script/function
$@  all parameters to script/function (sees arguments as separate word)
$*    all parameters to script/function (sees arguments as single word)
Note
$*   is rarely the right choice.
$@ handles empty parameter list and white-space within parameters correctly
$@ should usually be quoted like so "$@"

Debugging
To perform a syntax check/dry run of your bash script run:

bash -n myscript.sh

To produce a trace of every command executed run:

bash -v myscripts.sh

To produce a trace of the expanded command use:

bash -x myscript.sh

-v and -x can also be made permanent by adding
set -o verbose and set -o xtrace to the script prolog.
This might be useful if the script is run on a remote machine, e.g.
a build-bot and you are logging the output for remote inspection.

Signs you should not be using a bash script

    your script is longer than a few hundred lines of code
    you need data structures beyond simple arrays
    you have a hard time working around quoting issues
    you do a lot of string manipulation
    you do not have much need for invoking other programs or pipe-lining them
    you worry about performance

Instead consider scripting languages like Python or Ruby.
